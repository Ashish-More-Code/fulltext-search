        1>SearchQuery converts the user input into a format that PostgreSQLâ€™s full-text search engine can process. 
        It ensures the search terms are interpreted correctly, handling nuances like stemming, stop words, and lexemes.
        2>SearchQuery translates the terms the user provides into a search query object that the database compares to a search vector.
        By default, all the words the user provides are passed through the stemming algorithms, 
        and then it looks for matches for all of the resulting terms.
